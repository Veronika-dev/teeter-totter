You can manage those objectâ€™s placement by arrow keys to keep teeter totter on balance.
- Your task is keeping this balance as much as you can.

### Rules of the game 
- The maximum bending percentage is %30, if it exceeds this limit, simulation ends.
- If there is extra 20kgm(10kg * 2m) on the one side, simulation ends immediately.
- Distance from center will be considered as factor when placing the objects to keep teeter totter on balance.
- The drop speed of boxes may increase as the time goes on.
- The width of teeter totter is 10m.
- There are three different object type with different weights from 1 to 10kg. Triangle, circle and rectangle. The size of the boxes is determined by its weight.
- On the left side, only falling objects can be placed. You can control objects with arrow keys. The placement of objects should keep balance as its best.
